# color-palette-generator

My program can analyze any image uploaded by the user. Part of this analysis involves looping through every pixel in the image and storing its RGB color values in a dictionary. The corresponding values in the dictionary represent the number of times that color appears in the image. My program then displays a 250 by 250 image, which shows the top 5 colors in that image. It should be noted that images uploaded by the user which predominantly consist of multiple shades of pink, for example, will generate a palette with colors that are very alike, and perhaps indistinguishable to the naked eye.
